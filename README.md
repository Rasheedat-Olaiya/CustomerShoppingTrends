### Project Overview
---

The Project shows valuable consumer behaviour and purchasing patterns insights. Understanding customer preferences and trends is critical for businesses to tailor their products, marketing strategies, and overall customer experience.



### Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is the "shopping_trends.csv" file. This dataset encompasses various features related to customer shopping preferences, gathering essential information for businesses seeking to enhance their understanding of their customer base. The features include customer age, gender, purchase amount, preferred payment methods, frequency of purchases, and feedback ratings.Â 

### Tools

- Jupyter Notebook (Data Cleaning, Exploration, Analysis and Visualization)
   - [Download here]([https://jupyter.org/])


### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Importing Libraries and Loading the Dataset
2. Checking and Removing duplicaties and null values,
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Descriptive Analysis

involved exploring some answers to key questions, such as:

- What are the most frequently purchased items (top products)?
- How are the purchases distributed across different categories of items (e.g., clothing, accessories, shoes)?
- What is the distribution of review ratings given by customers?
- What percentage of customers have a subscription, and does subscription status impact purchase behavior?
- How frequently are discounts applied, and does this impact the purchase amount?

### Diagnostic Analysis

involved exploring some answers to key questions, such as:

- Are there any significant differences in purchase behavior between male and female customers?
- Are there patterns in the frequency of purchases (e.g., weekly, fortnightly, monthly) and how they relate to other variables like age or gender?
- Is there a relationship between having a subscription and making more frequent purchases?
- Does the choice of shipping type impact the purchase amount, and are there geographical variations in shipping preferences?
- How do items with discounts applied compare to those without in terms of purchase amount and frequency?


### Data Analysis

Analysis was carried out using the Jupyter Notebook.


### Results/Findings


The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The most profitable category is Clothing and the most profitable item is Blouse.
2. There is no correlation between having a subscription and making frequent purchases
3. The Female gender makes the most purchase.


### Limitations


I had to remove all null values  and duplicates from the table because they would have afftected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
